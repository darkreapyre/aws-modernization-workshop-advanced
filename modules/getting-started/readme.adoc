In order for you to successfully complete the workshop, we need you to run through a few steps to finalize the configuration of your AWS Cloud9 environment. Your AWS Cloud9 environment is accessable from the link:https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home?region=us-west-2#[AWS Console]. Once you've accessed the console, open the `[red yellow-background]#<User Name>#-AWSModernizationWorkshop-IDEStack` IDE.

=== Update IAM User Name Settings

Throughout the workshop you will be tagging and naming resources that you create, in order to differentiate your resources from the other workshop attendess. Since the majority of the AWS resources being created will leverage the *AWS CLI*, we will automatically create a variable to substiture the *IAM User* name provided into these commands.

To get started, open a new `terminal` by pressing the combination keys `[alt + t]` (Windows/Linux) or `[⌥ + t]` (Mac OS). Create a `USER_NAME` variable by running the following command, substituting your [red yellow-background]#<User Name># in place of [underline]#<LOWER CASE IAM USER NAME>#.

[source,shell]
----
export USER_NAME=<LOWER CASE IAM USER NAME>
----

[TIP]
====
For example, if your *IAM User* name is *Bob*, the command will look as follows:
[.output]
.....
export USER_NAME=bob
.....
====

Confirm that your [red yellow-backgroun]#<User Name># has been configured correctly.
[source,shell]
----
echo $USER_NAME
----

WARNING: The parameter value *[underline]#must#* be lower case!

You will now save this vairable so that we can use it throughout the workshop.

[source,shell]
----
echo "export USER_NAME=$USER_NAME" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
----

=== Update and install the necessary tools

Now update the `AWS CLI` and other pre-installed packages by running the following command:
[source,shell]
----
sudo yum update -y && \
sudo yum install -y jq gettext && \
pip install --upgrade --user awscli pip && \
exec $SHELL
----

After you have the installed the latest `awscli` and `pip` we need to configure our environment further.
[source,shell]
----
aws configure set region us-west-2
----

=== Update the IAM Instance Profile

Next we need to turn off the *AWS Managed Temporary credentials* as the Cloud9 IDE needs to use the assigned IAM Instance profile. Open the *AWS Cloud9* menu, go to *Preferences*, then go to *AWS Settings*, and disable *AWS managed temporary credentials*, as depicted in the diagram below:

=== Clone the source repository for this workshop.
Now we want to clone the repository that contains all the content and files you need to complete this workshop.
[source,shell]
----
cd ~/environment && \
git clone https://github.com/darkreapyre/aws-modernization-workshop.git
----

=== Installing 3rd Party CLIs
During the workshop we will be using a couple of 3^rd^ party CLI tools like `eksctl` to configure our EKS cluster, and `kubectl` to interact with our Kubernetes cluster. Follow the steps below to ensure that these tools have been installed:

TIP: You can learn more about the `eksctl` tool from this link:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/eksctl-eks-cluster-one-command/[blog] post.

Step 1:: Let's make a `bin` folder where these binaries will be stored and change our directory to the new location.
+
[source,shell]
----
mkdir ~/bin && cd ~/bin
----
+
Step 2:: Download the required 3^rd^ party `CLI` tools from their locations and make them "runnable", and add them to our `$PATH`.
+
[source,shell]
----
curl -skL "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/download/latest_release/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp && \
mv /tmp/eksctl ~/bin/
----
+
[source,shell]
----
curl -skLo ~/bin/kubectl "https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.12.7/2019-03-27/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
----
+
[source,shell]
----
curl -skLo ~/bin/aws-iam-authenticator "https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.12.7/2019-03-27/bin/linux/amd64/aws-iam-authenticator" && \
chmod -R +x ~/bin && \
echo "export PATH=~/bin:\${PATH}" >> ~/.bashrc &&\
exec $SHELL
----

=== Launch an EKS Cluster
It takes a few minutes to launch an EKS cluster, so we will have you launch one now, so that the installation can complete while you continue with the some initial modules. We will launch our EKS Cluster using the `eksctl` tool.

Step 1:: `eksctl` requires an SSH Key to configure your EKS nodes with.
+
[source,shell]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
----
+
NOTE: When prompted to enter a passphrase, press [ENTER]
+
Step 2::
Now that we have the key, let's launch the EKS Cluster. Our *EKS* cluster will be called `[red yellow-background]#<User Name>#-petstore` and will consist of the default, four `m5.large` *EC2* instances.
+
[source,shell]
----
eksctl create cluster --full-ecr-access --name=${USER_NAME}-petstore --nodes-min=2 --nodes-max=4
----
+
You can expect to see an output like the one below...
[.output]
....
[ℹ]  using region us-west-2
[ℹ]  setting availability zones to [us-west-2b us-west-2d us-west-2c]
[ℹ]  subnets for us-west-2b - public:192.168.0.0/19 private:192.168.96.0/19
[ℹ]  subnets for us-west-2d - public:192.168.32.0/19 private:192.168.128.0/19
[ℹ]  subnets for us-west-2c - public:192.168.64.0/19 private:192.168.160.0/19
[ℹ]  nodegroup "ng-c16b6b90" will use "ami-0923e4b35a30a5f53" [AmazonLinux2/1.12]

[ℹ]  will create 2 separate CloudFormation stacks for cluster itself and the initial nodegroup

[ℹ]  2 sequential tasks: { create cluster control plane "petstore", create nodegroup "ng-c16b6b90" }
[ℹ]  building cluster stack "eksctl-petstore-cluster"
[ℹ]  deploying stack "eksctl-petstore-cluster"
...
....

We will leave this process running, and get back to it later in the workshop. So let's open a new `terminal` by pressing the combination keys `[alt + t]` (Windows/Linux) or `[⌥ + t]` (Mac OS). Then we'll proceed to the *Containerize Application* module.

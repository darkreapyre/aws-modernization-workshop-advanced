*Lab Requirements:*
None

*Average Lab Time:*
15-20 minutes
****

In order for you to succeed in this workshop, we need you to run through a few steps to finalize the configuration of your AWS Cloud9 environment. Your AWS Cloud9 environment is accessable from the link:https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home?region=us-west-2#[AWS Console]. Once you've accessed the console, open the `AWSModernizationWorkshop-IDEStack` IDE.

=== Update and install the necessary tools

The first step is to update the `AWS CLI` and `pip` packages, as well as other pre-installed packages. Open a new `terminal` by pressing the combination keys `[alt + t]` (Windows/Linux) or `[⌥ + t]` (Mac OS). Once the new `terminal` is open, run the following commands:
[source,shell]
----
sudo yum update -y && pip install --upgrade --user awscli pip

exec $SHELL
----

=== Configure the AWS Environment

After you have the installed the latest `awscli` and `pip` we need to configure our environment further.
[source,shell]
----
aws configure set region us-west-2
----

=== Update the IAM Instance Profile

Next thing we need to turn off the Managed Temporary credentials as the Cloud9 IDE needs to use the assigned IAM Instance profile.

Open the *AWS Cloud9* menu, go to *Preferences*, then go to *AWS Settings*, and disable *AWS managed temporary credentials*, as depicted in the diagram below:

=== Clone the source repository for this workshop.
Now we want to clone the repository that contains all the content and files you need to complete this workshop.
[source,shell]
----
cd ~/environment

git clone https://github.com/darkreapyre/aws-modernization-workshop.git
----

=== Installing 3rd Party CLIs
During the workshop we will be using a couple of 3^rd^ party CLI tools like `eksctl` to configure our EKS cluster, and `kubectl` to interact with our Kubernetes cluster. Follow the steps below to ensure that these tools have been installed:

TIP: You can learn more about the `eksctl` tool from this link:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/eksctl-eks-cluster-one-command/[blog] post.

Step 1::
Let's make a `bin` folder where these binaries will be stored and change our directory to the new location.
[source,shell]
----
mkdir ~/bin

cd ~/bin
----

Step 2::
Download the required `CLI` tools from their locations. Make them Runnable, and add them to our `$PATH`
[source,shell]
----
curl -skL "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/download/latest_release/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp && mv /tmp/eksctl ~/bin/

curl -skLo ~/bin/kubectl "https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.12.7/2019-03-27/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"

curl -skLo ~/bin/aws-iam-authenticator "https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.12.7/2019-03-27/bin/linux/amd64/aws-iam-authenticator"

chmod -R +x ~/bin

echo "export PATH=~/bin:\${PATH}" >> ~/.bashrc

exec $SHELL
----

=== Launch an EKS Cluster
It takes a few minutes to launch an EKS cluster, so we will have you launch one now, while completing some initial modules. We will launch our EKS Cluster using the `eksctl` tool.

Step 1::
`eksctl` requires an SSH Key to configure your EKS nodes with.
[source,shell]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
----

NOTE: When prompted to enter a passphrase, press [ENTER]

Step 2::
Now that we have the key, let's launch the EKS Cluster.
[source,shell]
----
eksctl create cluster --full-ecr-access --name=petstore --nodes-min=2 --nodes-max=4
----

Step 3::
You can expect to see an output like the one below...
[.output]
....
[ℹ]  using region us-west-2
[ℹ]  setting availability zones to [us-west-2b us-west-2d us-west-2c]
[ℹ]  subnets for us-west-2b - public:192.168.0.0/19 private:192.168.96.0/19
[ℹ]  subnets for us-west-2d - public:192.168.32.0/19 private:192.168.128.0/19
[ℹ]  subnets for us-west-2c - public:192.168.64.0/19 private:192.168.160.0/19
[ℹ]  nodegroup "ng-c16b6b90" will use "ami-0923e4b35a30a5f53" [AmazonLinux2/1.12]
[ℹ]  creating EKS cluster "petstore" in "us-west-2" region
[ℹ]  will create 2 separate CloudFormation stacks for cluster itself and the initial nodegroup
[ℹ]  if you encounter any issues, check CloudFormation console or try 'eksctl utils describe-stacks --region=us-west-2 --name=petstore'
[ℹ]  2 sequential tasks: { create cluster control plane "petstore", create nodegroup "ng-c16b6b90" }
[ℹ]  building cluster stack "eksctl-petstore-cluster"
[ℹ]  deploying stack "eksctl-petstore-cluster"
...
....

We will leave this process running, and get back to it later in the workshop. So let's open a new `terminal` by pressing the combination keys `[alt + t]` (Windows/Linux) or `[⌥ + t]` (Mac OS). Then we'll proceed to the *Containerize Application* module.

=== Introduction
This module is designed to improve your undesrtanding of the link:https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/[AWS Code*] services like, link:https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/[AWS CodeCommit], link:https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/[AWS CodeBuild], link:https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/[AWS Codepipeline] and link:https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/[AWS Lambda] can be used for continuous deployment on link:https://aws.amazon.com/eks/[Amazon EKS].

The following *Reference Architecture* details the how the above AWS services will be leveraged and the specific steps we will follow for this module.

=== Reference Architecure
image:architecture.png[Architecture]

=== Setting up the CI/CD Pipeline

NOTE: The following section of the module assumes a working EKS cluster, created in *Amazon EKS* module.

To start, we need to assign a *ServiceRole* to CodePipeline, as permissions for some aspects of the pipeline execution process are granted to another role type that acts on behalf of CodePipeline, like EKS, rather than to IAM users.

The Service role is an IAM role that gives CodePipeline permission to use resources in your account. Service role creation is only required the first time you create a pipeline in CodePipeline.

CodePipeline uses this service role when processing revisions through the stages and actions in a pipeline. That role is configured with one or more policies that control access to the AWS resources used by the pipeline. You might want to attach additional policies to this role, edit the policy attached to the role, or configure policies for other service roles in AWS. You might also want to attach a policy to a role when configuring cross-account access to your pipeline. 

Step 1:: In the Cloud9 IDE `terminal`, navigate to this modules working directory.
+
[source,shell]
----
cd ~/environment/aws-modernization-workshop/modules/cicd/
----
+
Step 2:: Next we wil create the necessary Service Roles using the CloudFormation template in this modules wotking directory by running the follopwing AWS CLI command:
+
[source,shell]
----
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name "eks-cicd-demo-roles" \
--template-body=file://eks-cicd-roles-template.yaml \
--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
----
+
Example Output:
+
[.output]
----
{
    "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:<REDACTED>:stack/workshop-cicd-roles/686a6510-79b7-11e9-a777-0a58a0e3e17a"
}
----
+
Step 3:: Wait for the Template to finish deploying.
+
[source,shell]
----
until [[ `aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name "eks-cicd-demo-roles" --query "Stacks[0].[StackStatus]" --output text` == "CREATE_COMPLETE" ]]; do  echo "The stack is NOT in a state of CREATE_COMPLETE at `date`";   sleep 30; done && echo "The Stack is built at `date` - Please proceed"
----

==== Create Container Repository

Step 1:: As we saw with the other examples in this workshop, we will need to store our demo applications' docker containers, so next we'll create an AWS ECR respository for the application contianers by running the following command:
+ 
[source,shell]
----
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name eks-cicd-demo-repo --region us-west-2
----
+
Example Output:
+
[.output]
----
{
    "repository": {
        "registryId": "<REDACTED>", 
        "repositoryName": "eks-cicd-demo-repo", 
        "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:us-west-2:<.REDACTED>:repository/eks-cicd-demo-repo", 
        "createdAt": 1558127545.0, 
        "repositoryUri": "<REDACTED>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eks-cicd-demo-repo"
    }
}
----

==== Create Source Version Control for the Demo Applicaiton

Step 1:: Next we will create an AWS CodeCommit repository to store the source code for our sample EKS project. This is the source code for the application we are "developing" and will eventually push to "production" using our CI/CD Pipeline. Execute the following command in the Ckoud9 `terminal`.
+
[source,shell]
----
aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name eks-cicd-demo-repo --repository-description "EKS CICD demo application repository" --region us-west-2
----
+
Example Output:
+
[.output]
----
{
    "repositoryMetadata": {
        "repositoryName": "eks-cicd-demo-repo", 
        "cloneUrlSsh": "ssh://git-codecommit.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/eks-cicd-demo-repo", 
        "lastModifiedDate": 1558126857.734, 
        "repositoryDescription": "EKS CICD demonstration repository", 
        "cloneUrlHttp": "https://git-codecommit.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/eks-cicd-demo-repo", 
        "creationDate": 1558126857.734, 
        "repositoryId": "1d5e262b-ff0a-4555-a552-31a87db6373a", 
        "Arn": "arn:aws:codecommit:us-west-2:<REDACTED>:eks-cicd-demo-repo", 
        "accountId": "<REDACTED>"
    }
}
----
+
Step 2:: Next we will commit out sample application to the CodeCommit reposutory created above, by running the following commands:
+
[source,shell]
----
git config --global credential.helper '!aws codecommit credential-helper $@'

git config --global credential.UseHttpPath true

git clone https://git-codecommit.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/eks-cicd-demo-repo

cp ./sample-app/* eks-cicd-demo-repo/

cd eks-cicd-demo-repo

git add . && git commit -m "initial commit of sample app" && git push origin master
----

==== Create the Ci/CD Pipeline

Step 1:: Now that we have a place to store our docker container, a source code repository and the necessary Service roles, we can create our CI/CD Pipeline. Open a broweser tab and navigate to the link:https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines[AWS CodePipeline] Service Console. Click on *Create pipeline*.
+
image:create-pipeline.png[Create Pipeline]
+
Step 2:: After the *Create new pipline* wizard opens, the first step is to configure the *Pipeline settings*. Enter `EKS-CICD-Demo` as the *Pipeline name*. Select *Existing service role* and from the drop-down, select the IAM role we created in *Step 2*.
+
NOTE: The *Role name* should start with `eks-cicd-demo-roles-CodepipleServiceRole-...`.
+
Step 3:: Under *Artifact store*, click *Custom location*. From the *Bucket* drop-down list, select the S3 Buvket created in *Step 2*.
+
NOTE: The *Bucket* name should start with `eks-cicd-demo-roles-ekscicddemobucket-...`.
+
Step 4:: Click on *Next* to continue.
+
image:pipeline-settings.png[Pipeline Settings]
+
Step 5:: Next we'll configure the *Source stage*. Click the drop-down and select *AWS CodeCommit* as the *Source provider*.
+
Step 6:: For the *Repository name*, click the drop-down to select the repository we created in *Step 4*, `eks-cicd-demo-repo`.
+
Step 7:: Select the `master` branch from the drop-down for *Branch name*.
+
Step 8:: Keep the default recommended setting for *Change detection options* as *Amazon CloudWatch* and click *Next*.
+
image:pipeline-source.png[Pipeline Source]
+
Step 9:: Now we configure the *Build stage*. Click the drop-down and select *AWS CodeBuild* and then click the *Create project* link to create a new CodeBuild project.
+
image:create-project.png[Create Build]
+
Step 10:: A new browser window will open to create a new build project. Under the *Project configuration* section, enter `eks-build-project` as the *Project name* and provide an option *Description*.
+
image:build-project.png[Project Name]
+
TIP: Even though it's not required for this workshop, it's always a good practice to tag your AWS resources for _Cost Allocation_, _Access Control_, _Business Organization_ and _Automation_. You can read more about Tagging Strategies link:https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-tagging-strategies/[here].
+
Step 11:: Under the *Environment* section, ensure that *Managed image* is selected.
+
Step 12:: From the *Operating system* drop-down box, select *Ubuntu*.
+
Step 13:: Leave the *Runtime* as *Standard* and ensure that the you select `aws/codebuild/standard:2.0` as the *Image*.
+
Step 14:: Ensure that *Privileged* check-box is *checked*.
+
Step 15:: For the *Service role*, select *Existing service role* and choose the role we created in *Step 2*.
+
NOTE: The *Role name* should start with `eks-cicd-demo-roles-CodeBuildServiceRole-...`.
+
Step 16:: *Uncheck* the *Allow AWS CodeBuild to modify this service role* check-box.
+
image:build-environment.png[Build Environment]
+
Step 17:: Expand the *Additional configuration* section and add the following *Environmental variables* as the `Name`:
+
* `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` - Add your 12 digit AWS Account as the value.
* `IMAGE_REPO_NAME` - Add `eks-cicd-demo-repo` as the value.
+
IMPORTANT: Make sure there are no spaces in any of the values entered!
+
image:build-variables.png[Environmental Variables]
+
Step 18:: Leave the rest of the fields as their default and click *Continue to CodePipeline*. You will be returned to the CodePipeline build stage. Click *Next* to continue.
+
image:build-complete.png[Build Complete]
+
Step 19:: Click *Skip deploy stage* and confirm.
+
NOTE: We will not create a *Deployment Stage* to our pipeline because we will leverage an link:https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/[AWS Lambda] to handle the deployment to Kubernetes.
+
image:skip-deployment.png[Skip Deploy Stage]
+
Setp 20:: Review the CodePipeline configuration and click *Create Pipeline*.
+
image:pipeline-success.png[Build Complete]

==== Configure the Deployment Lambda Function
Now that we have created and tested the build of our pipeline in CodePipeline, we will next create an AWS Lambda function to as as a Kubernetes client and deploy the application to EKS.

Step 1:: Let's get started setting up the lambda function by first ensuring we are using this part of the modules' working directory. In the Cloud9 IDE `terminal`, run the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
cd ~/environment/aws-modernization-workshop/modules/cicd/lambda-eks
----
+
Step 2:: Next we will add some of our EKS parameters to the lambda configuration, by running the following commands
+
[source,shell]
----
sed -i -e "s#\$EKS_CA#$(aws eks describe-cluster --name petstore --query cluster.certificateAuthority.data --output text)#g" ./config

sed -i -e "s#\$EKS_CLUSTER_HOST#$(aws eks describe-cluster --name petstore --query cluster.endpoint --output text)#g" ./config

sed -i -e "s#\$EKS_CLUSTER_NAME#petstore#g" ./config

sed -i -e "s#\$EKS_CLUSTER_USER_NAME#lambda#g" ./config
----
+
These commands will:
+
. Add the EKS Certificate to the deployment lambda configuration.
. Add the EKS Endpoint to the deployment lambda configuration.
. Add the EKS Cluster name to the depployment lambda configuration.
. Add an EKS Cluster user and context, called `lambda`, to the deployment lambda configuration.
+
NOTE: Running the above command assumes a working EKS cluster, called `petstore`, created in *Amazon EKS* module.
+
Step 3:: Next we create a link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Kubernetes Secret] to give our deployment lambda access to the EKS cluster. First, we need to get the the `secrets` resource.
+
[source,shell]
----
SECRET_NAME=$(kubectl get secrets -o json | jq -r '.items[].metadata["name"]')

echo $SECRET_NAME
----
+
Example Output:
+
[.output]
----
default-token-wnlw5
----
+
Step 4:: Now we update the deployment lambda confguration file with the secrets token from the above output.
+
[source,shell]
----
sed -i -e "s#\$TOKEN#$(kubectl get secret $SECRET_NAME -o json | jq -r '.data["token"]' | base64 -d)#g" ./config
----
+
Step 5:: Next we build out lamabda function, package the necessary Javascript resources and then deploy it, uby running the following commands:
+
[source,shell]
----
npm install

zip -r lambda-package_v1.zip .

export LAMBDA_SERVICE_ROLE=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name eks-cicd-demo-roles | jq -r '.Stacks[0].Outputs[]|select(.OutputKey=="LambdaExecutionRoleArn")|.OutputValue')

aws lambda create-function --function-name LambdaKubeClient \
--runtime nodejs8.10 --role $LAMBDA_SERVICE_ROLE --handler index.handler  \
--zip-file fileb://lambda-package_v1.zip --timeout 10 --memory-size 128
----
+
These commands will:
+
. Install the Javascript package manager.
. Compress the Javascript packages for lambda deployment.
. Get the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html[Amazon Resource Name (ARN)] for the IAM Service Role that gives lambda the necessary EKS service permissions.
. Deploy the lambda function, `LambdaKubeClient`, using the AWS CLI.

+
Example Output:
[.output]
----
{
    "TracingConfig": {
        "Mode": "PassThrough"
    }, 
    "CodeSha256": "47bY+tj2yvUpBeYUXYg0/uNeJJP2GdizPwRxM8bjfnE=",

    "Handler": "index.handler", 
    "Runtime": "nodejs8.10", 
    "Description": ""
}
----

Step 10:: Now that oiur deployment lambda function has been created and deployed within our AWS Account, we need to provide it with admin access to the Kubernetes cluster. This is accomplished by providing it with Role-based access control (link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/[RBAC]) to the default service account. Create a role binding by running the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl create clusterrolebinding default-admin --clusterrole cluster-admin --serviceaccount=default:default
----
+
Expected Output:
+
[.output]
----
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/default-admin created
----

==== Add the Deployment Stage to the Ci/CD Pipeline
Now that all our components are in place, we need to add a *Deployment* stage to our CI/CD pipeline, in order to deploiy our Demo Application to Kubernetes i.e. into production.

Step 1:: In your browser, navigate to the link:https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines[AWS CodePipeline] Service Console and click on the `EKS-CICD-Demo` pipeline we created.
+
Step 2:: To add a new stage to our pipeline, click the *Edit* button.
+
image:pipeline-edit.png[Edit Pipeline]
+
Step 3:: Next we add a new stage after our *Build* stage by clicking the *Add stage* button.
+
image:pipeline-add-stage.png[Add Stage]
+
Step 4:: When prompted, to provide the *Stage name*, enter *Deploy* and click the *Add stage* button.
+
image:pipeline-stage-name.png[Deploy Stage]
+
Step 5:: We now have a new stage to our pipeline called *Deploy*. Next we need to configure the actions that this stage needs to perform for our pipeline. To get started, click on the *Add action group* button.
+
image:pipeline-add-action.png[Add Action Group]
+
Step 6:: Once the *Edit action* dialogue opens, enter `LambdaKubeClient` as teh *Action name*.
+
Step 7:: Select *AWS Lambda* as the *Action provider*.
+
Step 8:: For the *Input artifacts*, select the *BuildArtifact* as the previous stage to our Deploy stage.
+
Step 9:: From the *Function name* drop-down box, select the `LambdaKubeClient` funciton that was created in the previous section.
+
Step 10:: In order to tell the function where to get the Demo Application docker image, enter `eks-cicd-demo-rep` as a lambda event parameter to our deployment lambda function.
+
Step 11:: Click on the *Save* button to save our action configuration.
+
image:pipeline-edit-action.png[Edit Action]
+
Step 12:: Click *Save* to update our pipeline changes.
+
image:pipeline-save.png[Save Pipeline]

=== Executing the CI/CD Pipeline
We now have a complete CI/CD pipeline that takes any code changes, triggered from our our Source Version Control repository, creates a new Kubernetes deployment coontainer and deploys this into production on our EKS cluster. To simulate the entire CI/CD process, click the *Release chnage* button to trigger the pipeline.

image:pipeline-complete.png[Pipeline Complete]

Once the pipeline has completed, we can confirm our Demo Application is running production by executing the following command in our Cloud9 IDE `terminal`.
[source,shell]
----
kubectl get deployment eks-cicd-demo-repo -o wide
----

Example Output:

[.output]

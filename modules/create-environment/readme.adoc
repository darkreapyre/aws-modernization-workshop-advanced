== Creating the Workshop Environment

****
*[underline]#Lab Requirements#:*

* An AWS account provided to you by the AWS Instructor.
* Working Laptop with Internet Access.

*[underline]#Note#:*

* All AWS resources used for this workshop are to be created in the *[underline]#us-west-2#* AWS Region.
* Any resources created during the workshop must be named with the *IAM User* provided.
****

=== Workshop Introduction
Welcome to the workshop on AWS Digital Modernization. The steps outlined below will allow you to quickly create an environment that will allow you to work with the instructions contained throughout this workshop.

NOTE: If you do not receive an e-mail with the *AWS Account* and *IAM User*, please see the AWS Instructor.

=== Create the Workshop environment using CloudFormation
Throughout the workshop you will be tagging and naming resources that you create so as to differentiate your resources from the other workshop attendees.

To effectively differentiate  your AWS resources, you will need to come up with a unique user name. The unique user name must be [underline]#seven# characters in length. 

During the workshop, we will refer to this unique username with the *[red yellow-background]#<USER_NAME>#* parameter. So whenever you see this, substitute your unique user name.

Step 1:: To get started, log into the *AWS account* with the *IAM User* name (_this should be your e-mail address_), that was provided to you by the AWS Instructor.
+
Click *Deploy to AWS*.

+
Step 2:: Provide a unique *Stack name* by replacing *[underline]#<USER NAME>#* with your unique user name to the beginning of `AWSModernizationWorkshop`.
+

+
This will allow your CloudFormation stack to be uniquely identifiable.
+
[TIP]
====
For example, if your unique user name is *bobcat1*, the *Stack name* parameter will look as follows:
[.output]
.....
bobcat1-AWSModernizationWorkshop
.....
====
+
Step 3:: Select `t2.large` as the *Cloud9 Instance type*.

+
Step 4:: Keep the other parameters at their default.
+
Step 5:: Check both *Capabilities* check-boxes.

+
Step 6:: Click *Create Stack*.

****
The CloudFormation Template will create the following resources in your AWS Account:

* `C9InstanceFunctionRole` - IAM Role for access to AWS resources created suring the Workshop.
* `C9InstanceFunction` - Lambda Function to map the IAM Role to the Cloud9 Instance.
* `C9InstanceCR` - Cloud9 IDE Instance.
****

It should take around [underline]#*15 minutes*# for the environment to be deployed. Use the link:https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2[AWS CloudFormation] service console to see the status of you stack. Once the environment has been deployed, you will see the [green]#*CREATE_COMPLETE*# message for your *[red yellow-background]#<User_Name>#-AWSModernizationWorkshop* stack. Once you see this, you may proceed with the additional configuration steps in the *Getting Started* module.

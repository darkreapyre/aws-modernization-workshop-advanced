Step 6:: Click *Create Stack*.

****
The CloudFormation Template will create the following resources in your AWS Account:

* `C9InstanceFunctionRole` - IAM Role for access to AWS resources created suring the Workshop.
* `C9InstanceFunction` - Lambda Function to map the IAM Role to the Cloud9 Instance.
* `C9InstanceCR` - Cloud9 IDE Instance.

////
WARNING: If you recive an error creating the CloudFormation Stack, it may be due to `t2.micro` instance availability in the new `us-west-2d` *Availability Zone*. Simply delete the Stack and click on the *Deplot to AWS* icon again.
////
It should take around [underline]#*15 minutes*# for the environment to be deployed. Use the link:https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2[AWS CloudFormation] service console to see the status of you stack. Once the environment has been deployed, you will see the [green]#*CREATE_COMPLETE*# message for your *[red yellow-background]#<User_Name>#-AWSModernizationWorkshop* stack. Once you see this, you may proceed with the additional configuration steps in the *Getting Started* module.

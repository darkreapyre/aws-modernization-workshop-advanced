=== Workshop Introduction

Welcome to the workshop on AWS Digital Modernization. The steps outlined below will allow you to quickly create an environment that will allow you to work with the instructions contained througout this workshop.

NOTE: If you do not recive an e-mail with the *AWS Account* and *IAM User*, please see the AWS Instructor.

=== Create the Workshop environment using CloudFormation

Step 1:: Log into the *AWS account* with the *IAM User* credentials provided to you and click *Deploy to AWS*:

+
Step 2:: Provide a unique *Stack name* by replacing *[underline]#<USER NAME>#* with your IAM User Name to the beginning of `AWSModernizationWorkshop`.
+
[TIP]
====
For example, if your *IAM User* name is *Bob*, the *Stack name* parameter will look as follows:
[.output]
.....
bob-AWSModernizationWorkshop
.....
====
+
This will allow you to differentiate your resources from other Woskhop attendees.

+
Step 6:: Click *Create Stack*.

****
The CloudFormation Template will create the following resources in your AWS Account:

* `C9InstanceFunctionRole` - IAM Role for access to AWS resources created suring the Workshop.
* `C9InstanceFunction` - Lambda Function to map the IAM Role to the Cloud9 Instance.
* `C9InstanceCR` - Cloud9 IDE Instance.

////
WARNING: If you recive an error creating the CloudFormation Stack, it may be due to `t2.micro` instance availability in the new `us-west-2d` *Availability Zone*. Simply delete the Stack and click on the *Deplot to AWS* icon again.
////
It should take around [underline]#*15 minutes*# for the environment to be deployed. Use the link:https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2[AWS CloudFormation] service console to see the status of you stack. Once the environment has been deployed, you will see the [green]#*CREATE_COMPLETE*# message for your *[red yellow-background]#<User_Name>#-AWSModernizationWorkshop* stack. Once you see this, you may proceed with the additional configuration steps in the *Getting Started* module.
